Introduction:
The development and deployment of FPGA accelerators are paramount in elevating computational systems. Present-day applications demand accelerators that deliver high throughput, minimal latency, and optimal resource utilization. Advanced tactics such as parallel computing, memory hierarchy optimization, and tailored instruction set architectures are imperative for achieving these goals. SystemVerilog, renowned for its robust feature set, serves as a reliable platform for designing, simulating, and formally verifying these sophisticated FPGA accelerators.

SystemVerilog as a Hardware Description and Verification Language:
SystemVerilog blends traditional hardware description language (HDL) features with cutting-edge verification capabilities. Its support for constrained random verification (CRV), assertion-based verification (ABV), and transaction-level modeling (TLM) empowers designers to address the inherent challenges in contemporary FPGA accelerator architectures. Key features leveraged in FPGA accelerator design include:

- Parameterized Modules: Enabling reusable and scalable designs.
- Interfaces: Streamlining interconnections between modules.
- Assertions: Facilitating functional validation.
- Classes and Objects: Implementing advanced verification methodologies.
