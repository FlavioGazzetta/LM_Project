Processors have evolved dramatically over the past few decades, from early simple designs to the highly specialized and efficient architectures we see today. The history of processors is marked by significant milestones in performance, power efficiency, and functionality, as well as the development of numerous instruction set architectures (ISAs) that have influenced their design.

This book seeks to explore the evolution of processors, beginning with foundational architectures like RISC and CISC, moving towards the more modern developments in parallelism, scalability, and specialized computing. The modular nature of RISC-V and other modern ISAs has allowed for unprecedented flexibility in designing processors tailored for specific applications. Through exploring the strengths, weaknesses, and development trajectories of various processors, we aim to uncover the technological advancements that will shape the future of computing.
