She descended the cracked stone steps, the chilled air sharp against her skin, yet she felt no urge to rush. The world outside was changed, quietly waiting. She glanced back only once: Black Hollow—silent, formidable—seemed to settle into itself, not vanquished but heard. For the first time, its silhouette didn’t loom, but stood dignified in the softening dawn.

Each footstep in the frost-bitten grass became a vow. Marianne would speak of what she’d witnessed, not as a tale of terror, but as a testament to longing and memory. She would recall the delicate brush of a lost child’s hand, the hush of mourning, the insistent hope that someone might still listen. And she would remember her own trembling resolve—the moment she let compassion eclipse her fear.

A wind lifted, weaving through the brittle branches overhead, carrying with it a shiver and a sweetness, the faintest echo of laughter and lullabies. She paused to listen, letting it fill the hollows inside her. In that stillness, Marianne recognized herself—not as a trespasser, but as a keeper of stories, a fragile bridge between what was and what waits to be remembered.

When the village came into view across the blue fields, she felt the weight in her chest shift, not vanish but nestle somewhere deep and necessary. To be haunted, she realized, was not always a curse. Sometimes it was a plea for gentleness, for witness, for a promise not to turn away.

With the first rays of light warming her face, Marianne pressed on—quiet, steadfast, and forever changed. Black Hollow would sleep, and so would its sorrow, but neither would ever truly be alone again.
