The manor seemed to breathe around her—a slow, rasping inhalation that made the candle’s flame shudder. Marianne pressed forward, the heavy velvet drapes and cracked portraits lining the hallway forming a gauntlet of watchful eyes. Each footfall awakened a memory in the old floorboards, a complaint of the past refusing to be silenced.

She tightened her grip on the candlestick, the wax pooling against her knuckles. Her thoughts flickered with fragments: the legends she’d dismissed as children’s tales, the warnings she’d overheard in the village, the subtle dread that gnawed at those who dared speak of Black Hollow after dark. Now, enveloped in the manor’s midnight hush, those stories no longer seemed so far-fetched—they pulsed beneath her skin, a living, writhing anxiety.

A door on her left creaked open of its own accord, spilling a sliver of icy blue light into the hall. Marianne hesitated, a tremor running through her core, but the same curiosity that had brought her here now urged her onward. She stepped over the threshold, every sense alert. The room was smaller than she expected, dominated by a shattered mirror that stretched from floor to ceiling, its surface webbed with cracks that distorted her reflection into a grotesque mosaic.

Her breath caught. For a moment, she glimpsed not herself, but a child—eyes hollow and mouth open in a silent plea—standing behind her in the reflection. Marianne spun around, heart hammering, but the room was empty. Only her own uneven breathing filled the air.

"Don’t look away," a voice whispered, so close it might have been her own thoughts. The words vibrated within her chest—urgent, pleading, desperate.

She turned back to the mirror, drawn not by bravado but by the ache of empathy for whatever soul might linger here, trapped in this fractured glass. She knelt, palm pressed to the cold, splintered surface. The candlelight revealed something etched in the dust at her feet: a name, barely legible—**Elise**.

The name resonated, sparking memories she couldn’t quite claim as her own. Flashes of laughter, the crisp scent of apples, a lullaby hummed in the dark. It was as if the manor itself was opening its wounds to her, inviting her to sift through scabs and secrets.

A chapter had closed, yes—but something far older had awakened. The boundaries that protected her mind began to fray as she realized the true cost of curiosity. Black Hollow Manor was not just haunted by ghosts—it was nourished by the hearts of those who dared to seek its truths.

The candle guttered, casting the room into shadow. Marianne straightened, trembling, the name Elise reverberating in her mind. The figure’s final warning echoed through the silence: **Some secrets are best left undisturbed.**

But in the darkness, Marianne swore she heard a faint, grateful sigh—as if a soul, unseen and long forgotten, finally believed in the possibility of being found.

She rose, not vanquished by horror, but changed by it. The manor waited, corridors yawning with unspoken stories, each whisper daring her to listen, to remember, to go deeper. And Marianne, steady now, walked on—braver and somehow more afraid—into the heart of Black Hollow’s terrible grace.
