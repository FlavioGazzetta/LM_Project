Marianne's heart thundered in her chest as she stood frozen in the doorway. The footsteps grew closer, echoing through the hollow halls of Black Hollow Manor. With a shaky hand, she raised her camera, the only source of light in the suffocating darkness.

As the footsteps drew nearer, a figure emerged from the shadows. A woman, clad in a tattered gown that seemed to float around her like mist. Her face was obscured by a veil, and her steps made no sound against the ancient floorboards. Marianne's breath caught in her throat as she realized the woman was gliding towards her with an otherworldly grace.

"Who are you?" Marianne's voice quivered, the words barely a whisper in the oppressive silence of the manor.

The woman stopped just a few feet away, her gaze hidden behind the veil. A cold wind swept through the corridor, extinguishing Marianne's flashlight and plunging them into total darkness.

"Leave this place," the woman's voice was like the sigh of the wind through the trees, haunting and ethereal. "Darkness dwells within these walls, and it hungers for souls."

Marianne's heart raced as she fumbled for her phone, desperate for any source of light. But when she looked up, the woman was gone, swallowed by the shadows. Panic clawed at her chest, urging her to flee, but something deeper, darker, rooted her to the spot.

With trembling hands, Marianne raised her camera once more, the flash illuminating the hallway in stark, blinding light. And in that moment, she saw them.

Figures, spectral and twisted, lining the corridor like silent sentinels. Their eyes glowed with an unholy light, fixated on Marianne with a hunger that chilled her to the bone. She staggered back, her heart pounding in her ears as she turned to run, only to find the door slammed shut, trapping her in the heart of Black Hollow Manor.

Whispers surrounded her, a cacophony of voices that seemed to seep from the very walls themselves. They spoke of ancient curses, of tormented souls seeking retribution, of a darkness that bled into the very foundation of the manor.

Marianne's breath came in ragged gasps as she stumbled through the darkened corridors, pursued by unseen forces that toyed with her sanity. The air grew thick with the stench of decay, and shadows writhed like living things, reaching out with icy fingers that grasped at her flesh.

And as Marianne's screams pierced the night, lost in the echoes of Black Hollow Manor, the darkness claimed her, swallowing her whole in its insatiable maw. The manor stood silent once more, its secrets buried deep within its walls, waiting for the next unsuspecting soul to cross its threshold.
