Marianne's heart thundered in her chest, each beat a drumming reminder of her precarious situation. The flashlight in her camera bag suddenly felt inadequate, its beam feeble against the oppressive darkness that now enveloped her. A prickle of unease crawled up her spine as she considered the text message and the unseen watcher lurking in the shadows.

With trembling hands, she switched on her flashlight and aimed it into the murky depths of the manor's entrance. The light danced over ancient tapestries that hung like specters on the walls, dust motes swirling in its wake. The air was thick with the scent of decay, a mixture of mildew and something more sinister that made Marianne's stomach churn.

As the sound of footsteps drew closer, Marianne's instincts screamed at her to flee, to turn and run back to the safety of her car. But something held her rooted to the spot, a morbid curiosity that whispered of untold secrets waiting to be unraveled within those haunted walls.

The footsteps ceased, and a figure emerged from the darkness—a woman cloaked in shadows, her features obscured by the dim light. Marianne's breath caught in her throat as the woman extended a hand, beckoning her forward with a gesture both elegant and chilling.

"I've been expecting you," the woman's voice was a melodic whisper, tinged with a hint of malice that sent a shiver down Marianne's spine.

Despite every fiber of her being screaming at her to turn and flee, Marianne found herself stepping over the threshold, the door closing behind her with a finality that echoed through the empty halls.

As the woman led her deeper into the manor, Marianne's senses were assaulted by a cacophony of whispers that seemed to emanate from the very walls themselves. Each step she took felt like a descent into madness, the boundaries between reality and nightmare blurring with every passing moment.

And as she ventured further into the heart of Black Hollow Manor, Marianne realized with a sinking dread that the true horror of the place was not the decay or the darkness—it was the malevolent presence that awaited her, hungry for her fear and her soul.
