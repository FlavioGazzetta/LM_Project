Marianne closed the door softly behind her, feeling the weight of the centuries slip from her shoulders. The murmurs of those gathered drifted through the rooms, low and bright—stories spilling like lantern light into corners that had once hoarded their shadows. She moved slowly, fingertips grazing the worn banister, the cool plaster wall, each surface familiar now, transformed by the night’s confessions.

She paused beneath the old portrait in the hallway, the one whose eyes she had always avoided. Tonight, she met their gaze. They seemed softer, somehow; the anger and sorrow that once carved grief into oil was replaced by something quieter. A shared understanding, perhaps—a promise to remember, but not to recoil.

Upstairs, she found her room as she left it: tidy, expectant. On her pillow, a single feather—black, iridescent—rested like a benediction. Marianne smiled, letting her thumb press lightly along its edge. She didn’t know if it belonged to the rook that haunted the roof or to the history she’d finally claimed, but it felt right, as if the house itself had offered it as a token.

She climbed into bed, the hush settling close about her, heart thrumming with new steadiness. In the darkness, she listened not for footsteps or scratching at the walls, but for the simple breath of the house—the gentle, living pulse of a place that no longer wanted to frighten anyone away.

Before sleep claimed her, Marianne shaped a silent promise: she would keep the stories alive, the doors open, the hearth warm for whoever needed sanctuary. If ghosts lingered, they could rest. If memories pressed in, they could be met with kindness, not fear.

Outside, dawn crept up the valley, pale and sure. Black Hollow would wake as it always had, roots deep and strong. And Marianne, at its heart, finally belonged not just to the past, but to every hopeful morning yet to come.
