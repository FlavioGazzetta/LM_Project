At her back, the door eased shut with a mournful groan, sealing her into the hush that pressed in like a second skin. Marianne’s steps grew deliberate, candlelight trembling along the corridor’s walls, igniting new shadows with every stride. She felt the weight of the manor’s gaze, not malevolent but yearning, as if the house itself ached for remembrance.

She paused before a window rimed with frost, the glass opaque. On the other side, the night pressed close—an unknowable blackness, impenetrable and absolute. Marianne’s own reflection hovered ghostlike in the pane, joined by a fleeting impression: a tiny hand brushing hers, a phantom warmth that lingered then faded.

She let herself feel the sadness, the centuries of yearning and the burden of those unseen. In those silent moments, her fear transformed—curiosity became compassion, and dread made way for resolve. What if the stories she’d heard were not warnings but invitations? Echoes of lives unfinished, stitching her fate to theirs in fragile, silver threads.

The house grew quieter, as if holding its breath. It no longer sought to frighten her, but to be understood. Memories—hers and not hers—rose unbidden: a mother calling a daughter’s name, laughter swallowed by storm, a promise whispered through tears. The dust beneath her feet was not just neglect, but the ashes of longing.

She moved forward, drawn not by bravado or the thrill of darkness, but by a new tenderness for all the lost things—names forgotten, lullabies unsung, secrets buried beneath rotting floorboards. Near the grand staircase, Marianne knelt and pressed her palm flat to the wood, as if in benediction.

“I remember,” she whispered, meaning it with every fiber of her being.

The manor seemed to exhale, a release that rippled through its bones. Somewhere, a clock resumed its ticking, the rhythm gentle and steady. The air felt lighter, though sadness still shimmered at its edges—a sorrow that would never quite leave, but might finally rest.

Marianne did not flee. Instead, she made her way to the front doors, the candle now a nub between her fingers. She paused, listening to the silence, honoring it. When she stepped into the cold dawn, the manor behind her stood a little less heavy, its windows blinking in the pale light.

Some secrets would remain untouched, others carefully cradled. Marianne understood now: true horror was not in the haunting, but in being forgotten. And as she walked away, she carried Black Hollow’s story with her—a burden, yes, but also a strange, abiding grace.
