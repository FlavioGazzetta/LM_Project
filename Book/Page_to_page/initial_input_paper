The Echoes of Black Hollow Manor

The town of Ravenglen whispered of Black Hollow Manor, but only in hushed tones, as if the very mention of its name could summon the darkness within. Perched on a jagged cliff overlooking a restless sea, the mansion stood like a rotting corpse, its windows blind and hollow, its walls tangled with ivy that clawed at its crumbling stone like the grasp of unseen hands. No one in living memory had dared cross its threshold—until tonight.

Marianne Archer gripped the steering wheel of her rusting sedan as the rain lashed against the windshield. The road to the manor was a serpentine path, barely wide enough for a single car. The headlights barely pierced the suffocating fog, casting long shadows that slithered into the trees like living things. She shivered, though the heater blasted warm air at full force.

It was just a job, she reminded herself. Photograph the interior for some eccentric collector who wanted to document "the beauty of decay." She’d laughed when the email arrived, thinking it was another one of those art projects designed to shock and awe. But the check had cleared, and Marianne, drowning in student debt, couldn’t afford to be picky.

The iron gates loomed ahead, half-eaten by rust. They yawned open as if expecting her, the creak of metal a scream in the silence. She hesitated, her instincts gnawing at her resolve, but she swallowed her fear and drove through. Gravel crunched beneath the tires as the manor emerged from the fog, larger and more imposing than she had imagined.

The air grew colder as she stepped out, her boots sinking into the mud. She swung her camera bag over her shoulder and approached the entrance, where a massive oak door waited like a mouth frozen mid-scream. The brass knocker was shaped like a coiled serpent, its eyes glinting in the dim light. She reached for it, her hand trembling, but before she could touch it, the door creaked open on its own.

Marianne froze. The interior was a yawning void, the darkness almost tangible, pressing against her like a weight. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, and she nearly screamed. Fishing it out, she saw a text from an unknown number:

"You shouldn’t be here."

Her breath hitched. She spun around, but the driveway behind her was empty. Only the fog remained, thick and impenetrable. The manor seemed to hum, as though the walls themselves were alive, whispering secrets she wasn’t meant to hear.

Then, from somewhere deep within, she heard the faint sound of footsteps.
