The town of Ravenglen continued its life, quieter now, with the echo of Marianne Archer's scream still lingering, though only acknowledged in hushed whispers. As for Black Hollow Manor, it stood as it always had - a malevolent presence, overlooking the town with its dark windows and crumbling edifice. No longer were the townsfolk tempted by the lure of easy money to step foot on its cursed grounds. It was as though Marianne's demise had drawn a line that no one dared cross. 

The echo of Marianne Archer still resonates within the manor, her scream forever etched in its ghostly halls, a testament to the darkness that has forever shrouded its past, present, and whatever future it may hold. The silence in the hollows of the manor is an illusion, filled with the echoes of the countless souls who dared to challenge its darkness. 

Each tick of the clock is a reminder of their fates, each creak of the floorboard a whisper of their terror, and each gust of wind that blows through its decayed grandeur, a sigh from the past.

And so, Black Hollow Manor remains, a dark legend etched into the heart of Ravenglen - an emblem of fear, a monument of despair, a tale of terror whispered from generation to generation. A grim reminder that some doors are best left unopened, some secrets best left buried, and some debts best left unpaid.

The final echo of the manor is louder now, resonating with the name of its most recent victim - Marianne Archer. Her name joins the chorus of the lost, a symphony of sorrow that sings out from the manor into the night.

And with that, we close the chapter on Black Hollow Manor. The echoes may continue to ring, the stories may continue to be told, but for now, the tale has come to its end. 

Good night, dear reader, and remember - in the quiet of the night, when the wind howls and the shadows dance, listen closely. For if you do, you just might hear the echo of Marianne Archer, forever trapped in the hollows of Black Hollow Manor. The end.
