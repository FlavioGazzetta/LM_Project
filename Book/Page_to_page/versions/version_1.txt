Slow, deliberate, getting louder with each passing second as they moved closer to the door. It sounded like someone—or something—was coming for her.

For a moment, she was paralyzed by fear. She wanted to run, to get back in her car and leave this cursed place behind. But then, she remembered the debt, the bills piling up back home. She had to finish this job; she had no other choice.

So, Marianne took a deep breath, pushed the fear down into the pit of her stomach, and stepped into the darkness. The door slammed shut behind her, sealing her fate.

The sound of footsteps stopped. Silence filled the manor, thick and suffocating. Marianne could hear the blood pumping in her ears, could feel the sweat trickling down her spine. She reached into her bag, her hands trembling, and brought out her camera. 

As she raised the camera to her eyes, the flash cut through the darkness, illuminating the rotten grandeur of Black Hollow Manor. And there, captured in the brief burst of light, Marianne saw it—the echo of the manor's haunted past, a specter of darkness and despair, staring back at her from within the frame.

Her terror-stricken scream echoed through the hollows of Black Hollow Manor, the sound swallowed by darkness, lost in the thunderous crash of the relentless sea against the cliffs below. From the town of Ravenglen, no one could hear her—the only witness to her fate was the manor itself, alive with the echoes of its sinister past.

And so, Black Hollow Manor claimed another victim, drawn into its decaying embrace by the allure of a paycheck, swallowed whole by the darkness within, leaving no trace behind but an empty car rusting at its iron gates.

In the end, Marianne Archer became another whisper in the silence, another echo in the hollows of the manor. For in Black Hollow Manor, darkness never fades; it only grows stronger, feeding on the fear and despair of those who dare to cross its threshold.

The town of Ravenglen continued to whisper about the manor, but now, their whispers carried a new name. A name that would forever be associated with the echoes of Black Hollow Manor—Marianne Archer. 

And so, the story of Black Hollow Manor continued as it always had, in hushed whispers and silent screams, amid the echoes lost in its hollows, forever echoing the sinister past of Ravenglen’s darkest legend. The end.
