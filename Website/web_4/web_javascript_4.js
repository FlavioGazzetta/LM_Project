Your JavaScript code for the mobile menu toggle function is correct. It toggles the visibility of the navigation links when the hamburger menu button is clicked on smaller screens.

If you want to add more interactivity or functionality to the website, here are some additional enhancements you can consider:

1. **Smooth Scrolling**: Implement smooth scrolling to anchor links within the page for a more polished user experience.
   
```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#"]').forEach(anchor => {
    anchor.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
        e.preventDefault();

        document.querySelector(this.getAttribute('href')).scrollIntoView({
            behavior: 'smooth'
        });
    });
});
```

2. **Form Validation**: If you have a form on your website, you can add client-side form validation to ensure that users input valid information before submission.

3. **Image Slider**: Enhance the "Featured Section" by adding an image slider or carousel to showcase multiple images or content.

4. **Modal Windows**: Implement modal windows for additional content like image galleries, videos, or detailed information.

5. **Dynamic Content Loading**: Load dynamic content from an API or database to display real-time data on the website.

Feel free to incorporate any of these enhancements or reach out if you have any specific requirements or questions related to web development.
