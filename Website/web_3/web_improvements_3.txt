Thank you for the detailed requirements and code provided. I have reviewed the website components and suggested improvements based on each section. I have also added a new feature called Interactive Product Carousel to enhance the website further. 

I have made sure to address every requirement and recommend enhancements to meet the standards of design, functionality, and user experience. 

If you have any specific preferences or additional requirements, please let me know, and I'll be happy to incorporate them into the website development process. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance. I look forward to working on this project with you.
