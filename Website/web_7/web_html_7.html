It seems like the updates have successfully addressed the additional requirements and enhanced the website's functionality. However, as a perfectionist, I believe there's always room for improvement. Let's continue refining the website to make it even better.

Here are a few more enhancements we can make:

1. **Design and Layout:**
   - Consider adding hover effects to the navigation links for better interactivity.
   - Introduce subtle animations to elements like buttons or images to make the site more dynamic.

2. **Features and Functionality:**
   - Implement lazy loading for images to improve page load times, especially for content-heavy pages.
   - Add a scroll spy feature to highlight the active section in the navigation bar as users scroll through different sections.

3. **SEO Optimization:**
   - Optimize images with alt attributes for better accessibility and SEO rankings.
   - Implement structured data markup to enhance rich snippets and improve search engine visibility.

4. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and focus states are clearly visible.
   - Test the website with screen readers to ensure a seamless experience for visually impaired users.

5. **Performance:**
   - Minify and concatenate CSS and JavaScript files to reduce loading times.
   - Utilize browser caching and CDN services to optimize content delivery and speed up website performance.

Let's incorporate these improvements to make the website even more polished and user-friendly.
