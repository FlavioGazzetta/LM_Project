1. Introduction
The design and implementation of FPGA accelerators play a pivotal role in enhancing computational systems. Contemporary applications require accelerators that offer high throughput, low latency, and optimal resource utilization. Advanced strategies like parallel computing, memory hierarchy optimization, and custom instruction set architectures are indispensable for achieving these objectives. SystemVerilog, renowned for its extensive feature set, serves as a robust platform for designing, simulating, and formally verifying these sophisticated FPGA accelerators.

2. SystemVerilog as a Hardware Description and Verification Language
SystemVerilog amalgamates traditional hardware description language (HDL) features with state-of-the-art verification capabilities. Its support for constrained random verification (CRV), assertion-based verification (ABV), and transaction-level modeling (TLM) equips designers to tackle the challenges inherent in modern FPGA accelerator architectures. Key features leveraged in FPGA accelerator design encompass:

Parameterized Modules: Enabling reusable and scalable designs.

Interfaces: Streamlining interconnections between modules.
